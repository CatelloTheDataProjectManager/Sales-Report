## Sales Report with SQL & Pandas ðŸ“Š
### Project One Overview
Welcome to my GitHub page, where I showcase my project for the portfolio a comprehensive Sales Report system. This project encompasses various stages, including Database Connection, Data Cleaning, and Data Reporting.

### Database Creation
- Entity and Property Definition (MCD)
- Associations and Relationships (MLD)
- MySQL Workbench Modeling (MPD)

## Sales Report with PowerBI ðŸ“ˆ
### Project Two Overview
In this project, we will use PowerBI to create a comprehensive Sales Report system. The project encompasses various stages, including Database Connection, Data Extraction, Transformation, and Visualization.

### Database Connection and Data Import
We will establish a connection to the MySQL server, import the data, and execute SQL queries to explore the data.

### Data Extraction
We will extract data from the MySQL server to Power BI, where we will work with Power Query in Table view.

### Data Transformation
During the transformation phase, we will visualize the [Data Model ](https://github.com/CatelloTheDataProjectManager/Sales-Report/blob/main/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202024-06-07%20131537.png) (Star Schema: Fact Table/Dimension Table) and use the [Power Query Editor/Transform Data for ETL](https://github.com/CatelloTheDataProjectManager/Sales-Report/blob/main/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202024-06-07%20142143.png), transformation, data cleaning, data munging, and data wrangling. We will perform data filtering as in Excel and remove applied steps. We will also add columns, create conditional columns, and perform custom column transformations. We will ensure proper naming conventions for transformations and clean up columns. Finally, we will close and apply the transformations.

### Data Visualization
In this phase, we will load and visualize the data using various Power BI visualizations. We will create card visualizations and control visual properties through formatting and visual options. We will set the canvas settings to 1350x850 for optimal display. We will create stacked bar charts, selecting KPIs and formatting the X-axis and Y-axis, adding data labels, and displaying units. We will change the title and display the top N (5) values. We will also create slicers with vertical lists and format the data in table view (mmmm/yy). Finally, we will create line charts to display trends and enable cross-filtering by setting File/Options & Settings/Report Settings.

# Flask API for Data Visualization and Extraction

This project demonstrates the automation of an API using Python and Flask to facilitate the visualization and extraction of data. The API enables users to efficiently retrieve, visualize, and analyze data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pandas
- matplotlib (for visualization, if required)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment for dependency management.
3. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application to run the API.
2. Access the API via your web browser or a tool like Postman at the provided local server URL.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:
- `GET /data`: Fetches and displays data.
- `POST /data`: Adds new data to the database.
- `GET /visualize`: Generates a graphical visualization of the data.
